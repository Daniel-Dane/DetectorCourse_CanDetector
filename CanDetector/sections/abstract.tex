In order to gain a better understanding of proportional gas detectors and their operation, in this experiment we describe how to build one with householding items, in particular with a cider can as the tube to be filled with gas (cathode) and a common wire from a low voltage cable (anode), and one with more advance items.
To read out the charge collected in the wire from the gas ionisation from two particle sources, Fe-55 and Am-241, the detector is connected to a preamplifier and a computer with a Multi-Channel Analyser. With the collected charge measurements we can compare the gas multiplication factor measured with the one predicted by the analysis setup and by the experimental environment. The measured values are within $1\sigma$ of the predicted values. 
A measurement of the energy spectra for Am and Fe are also possible with the experimental setup and they are usefult to identify the energy peaks for different interactions.
