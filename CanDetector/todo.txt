Outline of the Beer Can detector
--------------------------------

A. Introduction:

   - Background on gas detector in particle physics
   - Brief overview of the objectives: Construct a can detector, calibrate it, perform spectrum analysis

B. Beercan Detector construction

   - Steps taken during the design and construction of the can
   - Table listing the physical dimensions (and uncertainties) of the can
   - The table MUST contain the following:
     	       	    -> Inner diameter
		    -> Outer diameter
		    -> Length
		    -> thickness of the anode wire

   - Pictures of the assembly

C. Experimental Set-up and Calibration measurements

   - Schematics of the experimental set-up
   - Description + plots of the following measurements:

     	i) Gain of the preamplifier (ie mean of the histogram) v. input voltage
	ii) Uncertainty of the preamp (sigma of histogram) v input voltage

   - Get a rough estimate of the coarse gain uncertainty
     (look at fluctuations of the sigma/mean for same voltage runs)

D. Energy Calibration of the MCA

   - Short explanation: We want to measure the conversion factor between energy and MCA counts

   - Plot Background spectrum. Mention how it was obtained. Discuss possible bkg sources

   - Plot mean and sigma of histogram v. Operating voltage.
     Identify the operating voltage we chose for the final spectrum

   - Plot MCA v. Energy using:
     	  i) refined Fe55 main peak
	  ii) refined Fe55 escape peak
	  ii) refined Am241 peak

E. Fe55 and Am241 Spectra analysis

   - Show Full Fe55 spectrum in energy units with fitted peaks
   - Show full Am241 spectrum in energy units with fitted peaks
   - Identify some of the extra peaks in the Am241 data

F. Analysis of Systematics

   - Brief explanation: Our energy resolution and charge measurement is dependent on beercan-related systematics.
   - Present the main systematics:
     	     i) rcathode uncertainty
	     ii) ranode uncertainty
	     iii) Volume uncertainty
	     iv) pressure uncertainty

   - Determine the expected avalanche Multiplication factor v. operating voltage:
     	     i) Propagate uncertainties into ln(M)
	     ii) plot data points in terms of M = V*(1pF)/Gain
	     iii) uncertinties on data = uncertainties on Gain
	     iv) Band plot for theoretical values of M

G. Special Gas Detector Results

   - Show Background spectra (discuss differences)
   - Show spectra of Fe minus background (discuss differences)
   - Show spectra of Am minus background (discuss differences)
   -Additional discussion about how smaller detector (and smaller systematics) can affect the energy resolution in the end

H. Conclusion

We measured a bunch of stuff. We found this. End of story.
