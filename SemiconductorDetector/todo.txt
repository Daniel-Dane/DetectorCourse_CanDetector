Outline of the lab report
------------------------------


A. Introduction:

   - Background on the semiconductor junction and use as a photodetector
   - Brief overview of the experiment: Assemble and characterize the performance of a silicon sensor

B. Methods:

   i) Sensor assembly (brief mention of the wire bonding process)

   ii) Sensor-Only characterization (small theory about semiconductors, capacitance + IV curves plot)

   iii) Preamplifier system (Description of the circuit + plots of the calibration, definition of parameters like ENC and rise time)

C. Determination of the sensor + preamplifier capacitance

D. Discussion (general statements about silicon-based detector advantages/disadvantages)

That's it...I think?
